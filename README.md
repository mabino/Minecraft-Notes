# Minecraft Notes

[A Minecraft installation](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) provides the [Minecraft Launcher](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Launcher), which enables the ability to have multiple game versions installed.  The different versions are managed under the Installations tab, and new and old versions can be added and managed by the Minecraft Launcher from the Installations tab.

The default installation will be the most recent stable release available.  Installation of earlier, official versions as well as preview releases can be started from the Installations tab by clicking on the New Installation button.  Official versions do not include support for mods, shaders, and other community-driven and created content.

Installation of versions that support mods and other features is typically started outside of the Minecraft Launcher interface.  For instance, downloading and installing [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) will add a new version to the Minecraft Launcher that supports mods.  Downloading [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) will add a new version to the Minecraft Launcher that support shaders.  To combine some or all of the features offered by multiple, alternative versions, some manual steps are required.

## Shaders

### Prerequisites

* [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads)
* A Shader Pack (a zip file containing assets that can be loaded by Optifine)
